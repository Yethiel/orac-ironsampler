# orac-ironsampler
Sampler with ADSR and rec arming. Based on norisampler


## Changes

Compared to norisampler shipped with Orac, the following things have been added/tweaked:

- Increase recording time from 2s to 20s
- Press Aux to arm recording instead of instant recording
- Fix saving of recorded samples with variable lengths
- Add ADSR from owen-osborn's example (https://patchstorage.com/adsr-graphics-demo/)
